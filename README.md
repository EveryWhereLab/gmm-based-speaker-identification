# Scripts of GMM-based speaker identification

This repository conatins scripts for performing GMM-based speaker identification tests. We use a small part of the Voxforge data set in the tests. To run the tests, you need to download the subset of Voxforge data using download\_voxforge\_dataset.py script. The split\_voxvorge\_dataset.py script is used to divide the data into training set and testing set. The GMM models can be generated by invoking the enroll\_speaker\_ids.py script(the number of Gaussian is fixed for each model). The bic\_search\_gmms.py script and the grid\_search\_gmms.py script can also be used to generated GMM models(these scripts may require more time to find hyperparameters). The test\_speaker\_ids.py script is used to test GMM models.
